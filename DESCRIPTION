Description: Provides tools for preprocessing, feature extraction, and segmentation
    of three-dimensional forest point clouds derived from terrestrial laser scanning.
    Functions support creating height-above-ground (HAG) metrics, tiling, and sampling
    point clouds, generating training datasets, applying trained models to new point
    clouds, and producing per-point fuel classes such as stems, branches, foliage,
    and surface fuels. These tools support workflows for forest structure analysis,
    wildfire behavior modeling, and fuel complexity assessment.
