\title{Add a ground class using CSF post-processing}
\usage{
add_ground_csf(in_las, out_las, csf_args = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{in_las}{Character. Path to an input \code{.las} or \code{.laz} file that
already contains FuelDeep3D predictions in the \code{Classification} attribute.}

\item{out_las}{Character. Output path for the updated \code{.las} or \code{.laz}.}

\item{csf_args}{List. Named list of arguments forwarded to \code{lidR::csf()} to tune
CSF behavior (e.g., \code{rigidness}, \code{cloth_resolution}, \code{time_step},
\code{class_threshold}).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{out_las} (the output file path).
}
\description{
Post-processes a FuelDeep3D-predicted LAS/LAZ by detecting ground points with
Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) and assigning them to a dedicated ground class.
This is used when converting a 3-class FuelDeep3D prediction into a 4-class output
where ground is encoded as class \code{3}.
}
\details{
\strong{Intended workflow}
\enumerate{
\item Run \code{\link{predict}} with \code{mode = "overwrite"} to write model
predictions into the LAS \code{Classification} attribute (typically classes
\code{0}, \code{1}, \code{2}).
\item Call \code{add_ground_csf()} to detect ground points and overwrite only
those points to class \code{3}.
}

\strong{What the function does}
\itemize{
\item Reads the input LAS/LAZ from \code{in_las}.
\item Normalizes heights with \code{lidR::normalize_height(..., lidR::knnidw())}
so ground detection is more stable across sloped terrain and varying elevations.
\item Builds a CSF ground-classification algorithm using \code{lidR::csf()} with
parameters provided in \code{csf_args}.
\item Runs \code{lidR::classify_ground()} to label ground points.
\item Rewrites only the ground points to class \code{3}, while preserving the
original FuelDeep3D predicted classes for non-ground points.
\item Writes the updated LAS/LAZ to \code{out_las}.
}

\strong{Class mapping}
\itemize{
\item \code{0, 1, 2}: preserved from the FuelDeep3D prediction already stored in
\code{Classification}.
\item \code{3}: assigned to points detected as ground by CSF.
}

\strong{Dependencies}
\itemize{
\item \pkg{lidR} for I/O, height normalization, and ground classification.
\item \pkg{RCSF} provides the CSF implementation used by \code{lidR::csf()}.
