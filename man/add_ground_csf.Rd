\title{Add a ground class using CSF after FuelDeep3D prediction}
\usage{
add_ground_csf(in_las, out_las, csf_args = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{in_las}{Character. Path to an input \code{.las} or \code{.laz} file that
already contains FuelDeep3D predictions in the \code{Classification} field.}

\item{out_las}{Character. Path to write the output \code{.las} or \code{.laz}
file. Ground points will be set to class \code{3}.}

\item{csf_args}{List. Arguments forwarded to \code{lidR::csf()} to tune the
CSF algorithm (e.g., \code{rigidness}, \code{cloth_resolution},
\code{time_step}, \code{class_threshold}).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{out_las} (the output file path).
}
\description{
After FuelDeep3D writes predicted labels into the LAS \code{Classification}
field (typically classes 0/1/2), this function runs Cloth Simulation Filtering
(CSF) ground detection and assigns detected ground points to class \code{3}.
Non-ground points keep their original predicted classes.
}
\details{
Internally, heights are normalized (via \code{lidR::normalize_height()})
before running CSF.

Requirements:
\itemize{
\item \pkg{lidR} for reading/writing LAS and running CSF ground classification.
\item \pkg{RCSF} provides the CSF implementation used by \code{lidR::csf()}.
}

Output classes:
\itemize{
\item \code{0,1,2} are preserved from the original FuelDeep3D predictions.
\item \code{3} is assigned to points classified as ground by CSF.
}
